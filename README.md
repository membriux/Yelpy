# Yelpy

Developed from scratch a simple clone of Yelp app that we use to teach CodePath's iOS Curriculum utilized by more than 600+ students every year. This is an iOS (Swift) that integrates Yelp Fusion API, custom MongoDB + Parse backend server hosted on Back4App. This project is to demonstrate what it takes to make a simple clone of Yelp in the course of 6 weeks.

## Setup/Installation üèó


1. MacOS (for running Xcode)
1. Download and install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
1. Open `Yelpy.xcworkspace` and run it

## Yelp API

We used [**Parse**](https://parseplatform.org/) (hosted on [**Back4app**](https://www.back4app.com/)) as our backend to handle login/register from the iOS app and also the group chat capabilities between users.

[**Yelp's Fusion API**](https://www.yelp.com/fusion) was used to gather data from businesses.


### Network

- `POST` /search ‚Äì retrieve businesses from a given search query in SF



## Database

We used [**mongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [**Parse server**](https://parseplatform.org/), hosted on [**Back4App**](https://www.back4app.com/) to manage our data for the application. This helps students focus more on how iOS works connecting to a database and not get distracted or overloaded with learning backend development. 

### Schema

Below is the database schema for our simple MongoDB (managed by parse and hosted by Heroku and Back4app).

**User**

| Name       | Type   | Descrpition                          |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| username   | string | n/a                                  |
| password   | string | user password (hashed)               |
| created_at | date   | when the user was created            |
| updated_at | date   | when the user was *recently* updated |

**Message**

| Name       | Type           | Descrpition                             |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| text       | string         | content of message                      |
| user       | user (pointer) | user object reference                   |
| created_at | date           | when the message was first sent         |
| updated_at | date           | when the message was *recently* updated |
